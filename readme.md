# Hi there friend
This is a source/fork of Chimezie Enyinnaya's simple support-ticket system.The tutorial can be found at https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-support-ticket-application-with-laravel-part-1

If you're going to use this just know now that it is insecure. I don't recomend its use in any production environment without first securing the application. Also there's no way to create admin users, all users can view all support tickets even those that are not theirs and just a bunch of security flaws. So don't use this in production. I made it for my own purposes for following along with his tutorial.

#### Do not use this in production environments.
